# Grundsteuer static page
This is the code repository of Grundsteuer by [DigitalService](https://digitalservice.bund.de). The [service "Grundsteuererklärung für Privateigentum"](https://github.com/digitalservicebund/grundsteuer/tree/main) allowed private individuals from July 4th, 2022 to August 31st to hand in their property tax declarations. After this time the service was replaced by this static page.
